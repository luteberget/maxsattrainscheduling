abstract="There is a wide consensus, which is supported by the hard experimental evidence of the SAT competitions, that clear progress in SAT solver performance has been observed in recent years. However, in the vast majority of practical applications of SAT, one is expected to use SAT solvers as oracles deciding a possibly large number of propositional formulas. In practice, this is often achieved through the use of incremental SAT. Given this fundamental use of SAT solvers, this paper investigates whether recent improvements in solver performance have an observable positive impact on the overall problem-solving efficiency in settings where incremental SAT is mandatory or at least expected. Our results, obtained on a number of well-known practically significant applications, suggest that most improvements made to SAT solvers in recent years have no positive impact on the overall performance when solvers are used incrementally.",
